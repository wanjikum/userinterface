				My name is Cheol Yang, a student from South Korea. Being a son of a father who worked as an interior designer for buildings, I was introduced to designs at a tender age. Back at home, I used to go to my fatherâ€™s job workshop and play around with the design tools. I would also watch him do his work, the way he held his tools and how he would address his clients. Through my father, I got introduced into a passion that would help me develop a hobby that is now the basis for a lifelong career. I am always grateful to my father for introducing me into the beautiful world of design. He taught me that the most vital stage of successfully undertaking a task is preparation. He inculcated in me a culture that has helped me develop a highly professional attitude in preparation for the career ahead of me. I grew up knowing that it is important to take my time in preparation before starting any task.

				When I was in the 9 th grade, I moved to the United States to start a new life. I later joined the military in Virginia and graduated later, having learned a lot in terms of leadership. Throughout my earlier schooling, I had not learned a lot on how to be an effective leader. However, joining the military equipped me with skills on how to work in a team. It helped me muster the discipline one needs to be a good team player. I got to learn how to be both a leader and follower.

				I am a sixteen year old student who is highly fascinated by math and physics. My love for the pure sciences has grown since I was a little child. I have always been an active participant of science projects and activities throughout school. In fact, I have had very few summer holidays because I spend most of the holiday time participating in summer math camps. I am now applying to join MIT because I would love to pursue a degree in mathematics. I feel that this is the field I am most familiar with and that can help me best express my strengths.
				</p>
				<p>As a young person who loves to be busy and productive, I do work as a tutor for young children in school. I love to help the children handle the academic challenges they face in class as well as to help me make an extra buck. Additionally, I do collect math problem sets and books for the children. I have worked as a counselor for older students who want to get information on subjects such as physics, math, informatics and chemistry. I have also been a judge on the math Olympiad for young students at my school besides attending numerous math and IT conferences.
