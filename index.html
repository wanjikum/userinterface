				My name is Cheol Yang, a student from South Korea. Being a son of a father who worked as an interior designer for buildings, I was introduced to designs at a tender age. Back at home, I used to go to my fatherâ€™s job workshop and play around with the design tools. I would also watch him do his work, the way he held his tools and how he would address his clients.</p>
				<p> Through my father, I got introduced into a passion that would help me develop a hobby that is now the basis for a lifelong career. I am always grateful to my father for introducing me into the beautiful world of design. He taught me that the most vital stage of successfully undertaking a task is preparation. He inculcated in me a culture that has helped me develop a highly professional attitude in preparation for the career ahead of me. I grew up knowing that it is important to take my time in preparation before starting any task.</p>

				I am a sixteen year old student who is highly fascinated by math and physics. My love for the pure sciences has grown since I was a little child. I have always been an active participant of science projects and activities throughout school. In fact, I have had very few summer holidays because I spend most of the holiday time participating in summer math camps.</p> 
				<p>I am now applying to join MIT because I would love to pursue a degree in mathematics. I feel that this is the field I am most familiar with and that can help me best express my strengths.As a young person who loves to be busy and productive, I do work as a tutor for young children in school. </p>
